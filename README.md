# SPARK: A Full-Stack IoT Smart Parking System

## üìñ Project Overview
This is a comprehensive IoT-based smart parking system developed for our final year BCA project at Don Bosco College, Panjim, affiliated with Goa University. The system integrates a full-stack web application with physical hardware to automate and manage the entire parking lifecycle, from vehicle entry to payment. The primary goal is to reduce traffic congestion and time spent searching for parking by providing real-time slot availability.

## ‚ú® My Role & Contributions
This was a collaborative team project. My specific responsibilities included:

*(Fill this part with your specific contributions. For example:)*
* *Developing the backend logic using PHP for user authentication, session management, and database interactions.*
* *Designing and implementing the MySQL database schema, including tables for users, parking areas, and reservations.*
* *Building the front-end for the User Dashboard and Wallet features.*
* *Assisting with the integration of the hardware components and the web application.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture
The system is composed of two main parts: a hardware layer for the physical parking lot and a software layer for user interaction and management.

1.  **Hardware Layer:**
    * **Entry/Exit:** An **RFID reader** verifies user identity for gate access, which is controlled by a **Servo Motor**.
    * **Slot Detection:** **IR sensors** are placed in each parking spot to detect the presence of a vehicle in real-time.
    * **Control Unit:** An **Arduino Nano** microcontroller processes data from the sensors and controls the hardware.

2.  **Software Layer (Web Application):**
    * A full-featured web application allows users to register, log in, view real-time parking availability, reserve slots, manage their vehicles, and process payments using the integrated **Stripe API**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Software:**
    * **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    * **Backend:** PHP
    * **Database:** MySQL
